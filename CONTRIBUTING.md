## Working with Docker üê≥

This project provides a Docker setup that allows working on it using any of the supported PHP versions.

To use it, you first need to install:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Make sure the versions installed support [Compose file format 3.9](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/).

You can then build the images:

```console
docker compose up --build -d
```

Now you can run commands needed to work on the project. For example, say you want to install the dependencies on PHP 8.0:

```console
docker-compose run codice-fiscale-php-80 composer install
```

or for enter the container

```console
docker-compose exec codice-fiscale-php-80 sh
```

## Testing

To run the test use the command below:

```bash
composer test
```
